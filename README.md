Archive of university group project. The goal was to make a simple game using an existing game engine. We are using Unity to make a game where the player needs to deliver the required amount of apples to villages. In the end, they will need to get to the giant apple to complete the game. They lose when they lose all their health to the wolves in the area who will chase after the player.

Unfortunately it is severely out of date and Unity will most likely not be able to run it in any comprehensible state.
