Archive of university group project. The goal was to make a simple game using a game engine. We are using Unity to make a game where the player needs to deliver the required amount of apples to villages. In the end, they will need to get to the giant apple to complete the game. They lose when they lose all their health to the wolves in the area who will chase after the player.
